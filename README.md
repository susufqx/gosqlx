## Gosqlx

This is an extension of `sqlx`. In this extension, I have realzied some simple orm operations like `create`, `read`, `update` and so on. In my projects in work, I have chosen `sqlx` to operate the database postgresql. Although this is very easy to use, I have to write the sql statements myself which is only easy to understand for me, not others. So orm extension is necessary to use in the projects which would be edited by other coders.
